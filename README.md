# PolDraCor (Polish Drama Corpus)

The 10 dramas included  in the Polish Drama Corpus (PolDraCor) were converted to TEI in a collaborative  effort led by Prof. Magdalena Pastuch and coordinated by. Barbara Mitrenga PhD, Associate Professor and Kinga Wąsińska, PhD, members of the  Historical Pragmalinguistic Team at  the Institute of Linguistics, at University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland.
The full texts were primarily sourced from the digital the National Library of Poland POLONA (www.polona.pl). OCR version required manual corrections which were performed by the aforementioned research group. Conversion from HTML to TEI as well as from txt to TEI received  technical support from Jan Wieczorek, PhD, Tomasz Bernaś and Tomasz Naskręt from CLARIN-PL (Common Language Resources & Technology Infrastructure)/Wrocław University of Science and Technology.  

The plays spanning  from 1772–1939 were selected based on  the following criteria:
- non-verse texts,
- originally Polish works,
- popular, ordinary, common nature
- everyday, moral, family topics,
- lively plots, that reflect  the realities of the era in which they were created, 
- the characters representing the different social classes of that time, 
- non-official and expressive language.

PolDraCor comprises  language material from sociopragmatic annotated Corpus of Polish Dramatic Texts (1772–1939) – KorTeDa.
The preparation of the initial files of the plays was done by Marta Kasprowska-Jarczyk, PhD. 
As of now, the corpus includes  10 plays, but it will ultimately consist of 50 plays. We are currently working on preparing the TEI version of the next 10 and more.
