# PolDraCor (Polish Drama Corpus)

The 50 dramas included in the Polish Drama Corpus (PolDraCor) were converted to TEI in a collaborative effort led by Prof. Magdalena Pastuch and coordinated by. Barbara Mitrenga PhD, Associate Professor and Kinga Wąsińska, PhD, members of the Historical Pragmalinguistic Team at the Institute of Linguistics, at University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland. The full texts were primarily sourced from the digital the National Library of Poland POLONA (www.polona.pl). OCR version required manual corrections which were performed by the aforementioned research group. Conversion from HTML to TEI as well as from txt to TEI received technical support from Tomasz Naskręt and Tomasz Bernaś from CLARIN-PL (Common Language Resources & Technology Infrastructure)/Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

The plays spanning from 1772–1939 were selected based on the following criteria:
- non-verse texts,
- originally Polish works,
- popular, ordinary, common nature,
- everyday, moral, family topics,
- lively plots, that reflect the realities of the era in which they were created,
- the characters representing the different social classes of that time,
- non-official and expressive language.

PolDraCor comprises language material from sociolinguistic annotated Corpus of Polish Dramatic Texts (1772–1939) – KorTeDa. The preparation of the initial files of the plays was done by Marta Kasprowska-Jarczyk, PhD.
